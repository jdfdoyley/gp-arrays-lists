# Arrays and Lists

In this application I will demonstrate the use of Arrays and Lists for holding
lists of items. The special for loop is also introduced as a looping mechanism
useful when working with Arrays and Lists; commonly called a "for-each" loop.
Note that for-each loops are only used with collections of things, like Arrays
and Lists.
